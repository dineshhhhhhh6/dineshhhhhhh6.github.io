## About Me
I am a passionate law student currently in my third year at SASTRA University with strong academic performance (CGPA: 8.12). Through multiple internships at the Madras High Court and exposure to maritime law, I have gained hands-on experience in drafting, research, and case analysis.  

This portfolio highlights my education, legal internships, moot court activities, publications, and extracurricular involvement.
